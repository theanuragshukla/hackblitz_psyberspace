## Experience
This hackathon only had 5 themes: 
- Fitness and sports
- Ed-tech solutions
- mental health and welness
- empowering youth financially
- collaboration and innovation

- The lack of variety and narrowness of the themes made it tough to decide a project idea which was both unique and exciting enough to impress the judges. But eventually we decided this idea and implemented it quite well.
- The UI is not that impressive and some of the features are not complete yet, but this project represents a great prototype for such an idea.
- we enjoyed our time while building it

## Lessons learned
- Figure out and setup deployment before going into development process. Steps such as adding Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, nginx.conf, and related ufw setups.
- Assign right task to right person
- Branch out before making changes (_looking at you mr. x_) :D
